# A reductionist whole-body model for lactate homeostasis
This repository contains the code used to model, and analyse the lactate homeostatis model described in:

# Usage
Install the requirements using:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Calculations and plolts shown in the paper are presented in the four jupyter notebooks:
- dynamic_simulation (Figures 6 B + F)
- basins_of_attraction (Figures 6 C-E + G, Figures S8 A)
- In_silico_mutants (Figures 6 H+I and S6 C+D)
- parameter_robustness (Figures S8 B-E)

Model definition and parameter calcualtions can be found in `model.py`
